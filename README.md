codeRED is an Android app that allows users to request or provide sanitary products. We have all been in situations where we forget our period product essentials, not knowing where to get them or being too embarrassed to ask. Through kind strangers, users can anonymously request for a sanitary product (pads, tampons) or painkillers in these situations. This app also helps transgender men who are afraid to ask and the countless homeless individuals experiencing period poverty (the lack of basic female hygiene products) worldwide.

By filling out the request form the user can easily ask for a product, and the time and location to receive it. This can be done completely anonymously by writing a message such as “leave under the third stall”. We recognise that safety is incredibly important, so if the user chooses to meet up, there is a randomly generated code word. Upon meeting up, this word is said to confirm the user is talking to the right person. If the person seems potentially dangerous, the user can easily walk away and not respond to the codeword.

To help others when they are in need, there is a ‘Requests Near You’ page. Requests from others will show up when they are within one kilometer from the user’s location. It is filtered by distance, and notifications to users who are within 200m of someone’s request.
